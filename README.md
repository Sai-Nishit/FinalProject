# Idea 1 : 
The project concept involves creating a digital art installation using **p5.js** combined with an **Arduino microcontroller**, equipped with an **ultrasonic sensor** and **buttons** to create an interactive website experience. The interaction occurs as follows: when a user moves their hand closer to the ultrasonic sensor, the digital images on the website become animated, adding dynamic visual effects. Additionally, pressing the buttons triggers changes in the background music, creating an immersive multimedia experience.

### Why I Chose This Topic
This topic aligns with my interest in combining technology and creativity to enhance user engagement through interactive art. It allows for exploring the integration of hardware and software to create a multisensory experience, blending digital art with real-world interactions. This project also provides an opportunity to deepen my understanding of sensors, microcontrollers, and interactive web design.

### Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs:
  - Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects the proximity of the user's hand.
  - Buttons: Serve as input triggers to change the music tracks.

- Outputs:
  - Visual Output: Animated changes in the digital art displayed on the website.
  - Audio Output: Transition or switching of background music based on button presses.

This integration of tactile and motion-based interaction with digital elements ensures a unique and engaging user experience.

# Idea 2 :
The second project idea is to develop a website inspired by my favorite anime, Monster, featuring two interactive characters: one representing the killer and the other the escaper. The entire webpage adopts a dark theme to match the suspenseful atmosphere of the story. The killer is highlighted with a lit circular area to add dramatic focus.

### Interactive Elements
I plan to integrate an Arduino and a PlayStation joystick to control the movement of both characters. The joystick will enable real-time control of the characters, enhancing the interactive experience.

### LED Feedback Mechanism
Additionally, I will include an LED system connected to the Arduino to provide visual feedback about the proximity of the killer to the escaper:

Green LED: Lights up when the killer is far from the escaper.
Yellow LED: Indicates that the killer is approaching the escaper.
Red LED: Warns that the killer is very close to the escaper.

## Why I Chose This Topic
This idea stems from my love for Monster and its psychological depth. It allows me to create an engaging, suspenseful environment while combining my interest in web development, hardware integration, and interactive storytelling. The project also serves as an opportunity to explore proximity-based interaction and hardware-software synergy.

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs:
PlayStation Joystick: Controls the movements of the characters.
Proximity Data: Tracked via the game's logic or sensors to measure the distance between the killer and the escaper.

### Outputs:
Visual Output: Dynamic movement of the characters and the lit circular area for the killer.
LED Feedback: Color changes (green, yellow, red) to indicate proximity.
This project brings together storytelling, design, and technology to create an immersive gaming-like experience on a web platform.

# Idea 3 :- 

The third project idea is to develop a website-based penalty shootout game featuring a penalty taker and a goalkeeper. The game will be interactive, with character movements controlled using Arduino and buttons, simulating a real penalty shootout scenario.

### Interactive Gameplay
The penalty taker will aim to score goals by adjusting their shot direction and power using the buttons.
The goalkeeper will move side to side to block the penalty shots, also controlled by buttons.
### Why I Chose This Topic
This project combines my interest in sports and interactive technology, offering a fun and engaging way to simulate a popular sports scenario. It also provides an opportunity to explore character motion and game mechanics while integrating hardware controls. By merging web development with Arduino, I aim to create a dynamic, skill-based game that enhances the user experience.

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs:
Buttons:
For the penalty taker: Control shot direction and power.
For the goalkeeper: Control lateral movements to block the shots.

### Outputs:
Visual Output: Movement of the penalty taker, goalkeeper, and ball animation on the website.
Game Feedback: Success or failure of the penalty shot displayed on the screen.
This project will effectively merge creative web development with hardware interaction, providing an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience
